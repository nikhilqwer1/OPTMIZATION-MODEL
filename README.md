# Description
Optimization is a critical component of decision-making in business, operations, finance, logistics, and engineering. In Task 4 of the CodTech Data Science Internship, the goal is to solve a business problem using optimization techniques like Linear Programming (LP), and implement the solution using Python libraries such as PuLP. This task enables interns to understand how mathematical modeling can be applied to find the best possible solution under a given set of constraints.
Optimization problems revolve around maximizing or minimizing a specific objective—such as profit, efficiency, or cost—subject to certain conditions or constraints. Real-world examples include minimizing transportation costs, maximizing production output within resource limits, or determining the best investment portfolio.
The PuLP library in Python allows users to define linear optimization problems, variables, constraints, and objective functions in a programmatic and readable format. It interfaces with solvers like CBC (default) or GLPK to compute optimal solutions.
The first step in this task is to identify or define a realistic business problem. A classic example is the Diet Problem, where the objective is to minimize the cost of a meal plan while meeting minimum nutritional requirements. Another common scenario is the Resource Allocation Problem, where a company needs to decide how much of each product to produce to maximize profit, without exceeding available resources like labor or materials.
Once the problem is defined, the intern needs to:
Formulate the objective function – what needs to be maximized or minimized (e.g., cost, revenue).
Define the decision variables – quantities that need to be calculated (e.g., units of product A and B to produce).
Set up constraints – rules the solution must satisfy (e.g., calorie intake ≥ 500, budget ≤ ₹100).
Solve the problem using PuLP's solve() method.
Interpret the results – read variable values and the optimal value of the objective function.
For example, in a simple diet problem, you might have two food items—rice and beans. Each has a cost per unit and provides certain calories and protein. The aim is to find the quantity of rice and beans to consume that meets the minimum nutritional requirement at the lowest cost. After defining the problem in PuLP, the script will compute the optimal quantities and the minimum cost.
The final part of the task involves explaining the insights from the solution. This means interpreting what the results imply for the business. For instance, if an optimization model suggests using more beans than rice, it might mean beans are a more cost-effective source of nutrition.
By completing this task, interns gain exposure to operations research and mathematical optimization, a field that underpins many AI and decision-making systems. They also develop the ability to transform abstract business challenges into formal mathematical problems and solve them using Python—a valuable skill in supply chain management, project planning, finance, and more.
